The model uses convolution kernels of different sizes in parallel channels to process raw data, and based on late feature fusion, a more comprehensive feature map is obtained. Furthermore, the information shar-ing between the two channels is realized through the attention mechanism so that the effective features of one channel can be reflected in another channel.
